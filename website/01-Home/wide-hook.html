        <p>In 2019 the Global Campus of Human Rights was entrusted by the <strong>European Commission</strong> to lead the new project “<strong>Development of Human Rights Education and Research at the National University of Timor-Leste</strong>” aimed at establishing a Human Rights Centre in Dili.
        	<br>
        	<br>
        	The goal of the Human Rights Centre is to engage in training, international networking and research activities.
        	<br>
        	<br>
        	It is envisaged that it will become an active partner of the Global Campus through its <span class="titolo_gc_asia_pacific">Asia-Pacific network</span>.
        	<br>
        	<br>
        	The completion date of the 23-month project is November 2020.</p>
