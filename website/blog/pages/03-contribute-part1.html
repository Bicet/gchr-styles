        <p class="margin_bottom_20">Submissions should foreground accessibility. The opening sentences of your submission are crucial: use simple, direct and lively language to give a concise statement of your main idea. By doing this, you help to ensure that readers look at your full submission. </p>

        <p class="margin_bottom_20">A variety of styles are welcome: analysis, stories, reflections, testimonies, best practices, recent developments, bold thinking, etc. Submissions can be in written/photo/video/audio form.</p>

        <p class="margin_bottom_20">We welcome submissions across the human rights-pandemics-emergencies spectrum, including topics related to:</p>

        <ul class="lista_con_pallini margin_bottom_20">
            <li>cross-cutting themes (eg, gender, equity, disability, poverty, sustainable development) democracy, governance, rule of law, non-discrimination) </li>
            <li>groups most at risk (eg, children, women, workers, migrants) </li>
            <li>specific rights and freedoms and corresponding duties and responsibilities (eg, health, education, food, housing, movement, life).</li>
        </ul>

        <p class="margin_bottom_20">The multiregional and multidisciplinary character of the Global Campus is integral to the initiative. Thus, contributions can have global, regional or local relevance; comparative perspectives are also welcome. Contributions can be multidisciplinary, interdisciplinary or from the perspective of any one of the arts, humanities and social sciences disciplines that enrich our networkâ€”including Law, International Relations, Sociology, Economics, Politics, Anthropology, History, Education, Health and the Arts.</p>

        <p class="margin_bottom_20">Submissions are invited in English. To enhance accessibility, we would be pleased to receive a second version of the submission in a different language: the English-language version will be used for review and editing, but we shall upload both versions to the website. Our website has a search facility that allows readers to find submissions in languages other than English.</p>

        <p class="margin_bottom_20">We ask that you use our template to submit your contribution. </p>

		<ul class="lista_con_pallini margin_bottom_20">

			<li><strong>Title</strong>: no more than 100 characters. Aim for something that captures the essence of your contribution in a simple but interesting way. Readers like titles that are jargon-free, attention-grabbing and concise, and these titles are also much easier to share on social media. Avoid italics as they interfere with online sharing. </li>
			<li><strong>Tags</strong>: 4-5 relevant keywords at the top of your contribution. </li>
			<li><strong>Region</strong>: specify the GC region relevant to your contribution. If the contribution is relevant to more than one region, or if you offer a global perspective, please state this. </li>
			<li><strong>Discipline</strong>: specify the discipline or disciplines that inform your contribution (eg History; Law; Political Science). </li>
			<li><strong>Type</strong>: if you submit an audio or a video file (eg, an interview, a self-recording) please add a title and short summary. Submit any image as a stand-alone file and indicate the caption and full copyright attribution. Hyperlinks and images can be included in any text or image-based submission.</li>
			<li><strong>Length</strong>: text: max 700-1200 words | audio: max 5 minutes | video: max 3 minutes | slideshare: max 20 slides | photo essay: max 5 photos, each accompanied by text (max 1200 words) | announcements: max 200 words.</li>
			<li><strong>References</strong>: referencing must be via in-text citations. Embed hyperlinks to your sources; try to link to no more than 3 words in your text, and for any particular source, include the hyperlink only once in the text. Do not use footnotes. A reference list can be added as a separate file for video/audio submissions. </li>
			<li><strong>Originality</strong>: please indicate if your submission has been published or submitted for consideration elsewhere and if you have permission to republish. Where a submission has been prepared specifically for GC Human Rights Preparedness, once it has been published, you are welcome to submit it elsewhere, noting where it first appeared. </li>
			<li><strong>Language</strong>: UK English (eg, ise not ize), but we would be pleased to receive your submission in a second language too. Please avoid using Latin terms unless absolutely necessary. Avoid symbols too: our readers come from different disciplines, so if you are referring to a particular legal provision, use paragraph, section, etc. </li>
			<li><strong>Your name, title, affiliation and research interests</strong>: max 50 words.</li>
			<li><strong>Photo</strong>: please include a colour photograph of yourself. If your submission is a blogpost, you may also include a licence-free, high-resolution photograph that is directly relevant to the content of your submission. Please make sure the photo is of high quality (1920x1080px).</li>
