        <p class="subtitle_page_programme lecturer_name">Chiara Altafin</p>

        <p class="ruolo_persona margin_bottom_20 centeredtext titolo_gc_europe"><span class="titolo_gc_europe">Senior Researcher</span></p>

        <p class="margin_bottom_20">Chiara has conducted research for various Global Campus projects and publications. She worked as senior researcher on the 7FP FRAME Project - “Fostering Human Rights Among European (External and Internal) Policies” (2013-2017). Related publications include: ‘The normative framework of the EU’s commitment to Human Rights: the Treaties, the Charter, Member States Constitutional traditions, and International Law’ (chapter jointly written with M. Nowak and K. Lucas) in <em>The European Union and Human Rights: Law and Policy</em>, J. Wouters, M. Nowak, A.M. Chané, and N. Hachez (eds.) Oxford University Press 2018; ‘The new Global Strategy for the EU’s Foreign and Security Policy at a time of human rights crises’ (article jointly written with V. Haász and K. Podstawa) in <em>Netherlands Quarterly of Human Rights</em> 35(2) 2017; ‘Assessing the strategic use of the EU fundamental and human rights toolbox’ (report jointly written with V. Haaz and K. Podstawa) FRAME Deliverable 14.2 2016, which focused on three crisis situations affecting human rights in EU policies and included case studies on Hungary and Poland, Turkey, and Ukraine. The <em>Global Campus Human Rights Journal</em> has published her following articles (jointly written with W. Lamer): ‘Referendums on the rise in Europe: Powerful tool of the populists or a step towards increased citizen participation in EU politics?’; ‘Challenges to the EU in 2017: Brexit Implementation, Populism, and the Renewed Attempt at Advancing the Social Dimension of the European Integration Project’. Since 2018, Chiara has been appointed as one of the lead researchers of the research group related to ‘children living in places of detention with their imprisoned parents in the context of the criminal justice system’, which is one of the six key areas of the United Nations Global Study on Children Deprived of Liberty led by the Independent Expert Manfred Nowak. In this regard she wrote (jointly with M. Nowak) ‘Data collection, children of prisoners and the UN Global Study on Children Deprived of Liberty’ in <em>European Journal of Parental Imprisonment</em> 5 2017.</p>

She was a visiting research scholar at the Center for International and Comparative Law of the University of Michigan Law School in Ann Arbor. Her doctoral dissertation examined the role, function and adequacy of public international law to deal with civilians’ access to, enjoyment and progressive realization of economic, social and cultural rights as controversially affected during and in the aftermath of contemporary scenarios of armed conflict and contexts of occupied territories. Particular attention was devoted to the normative responses advanced under international humanitarian law, in tandem with the functional development of other applicable international legal regimes, such as international criminal law and international human rights law..</p>

Chiara has conducted research and editorial activities for the Istituto Affari Internazionali (IAI) in Rome, in particular concerning contemporary piracy, the conflict of Nagorno-Karabakh, coercive diplomacy and sanctions in international law. Before becoming a qualified lawyer before the Italian Bar Association, she worked as a trainee lawyer at Avvocatura Generale dello Stato in Rome (2005-2007).</p>
