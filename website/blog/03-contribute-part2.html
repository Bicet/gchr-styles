<p class="subtitle_page_programme">Guidelines</p>
<p class="margin_bottom_20">All submissions to <em>GC Human Rights Preparedness</em> should have a clear human rights orientation, aiming overall to contribute towards the development of a rights-based approach to pandemics and other emergencies. </p>

<p class="margin_bottom_20">Submissions should foreground accessibility. The opening sentences of your submission are crucial: use simple, direct and lively language to give a concise statement of your main idea. By doing this, you help to ensure that readers look at your full submission.  </p>

<p class="margin_bottom_20">A variety of styles are welcome: analysis, stories, reflections, testimonies, best practices, recent developments, bold thinking, etc. Submissions can be in written/photo/video/audio form.</p>

<p class="margin_bottom_20">We welcome submissions across the human rights-pandemics-emergencies spectrum, including topics related to:</p>

<ul class="lista_con_pallini margin_bottom_20">
	<li>cross-cutting themes (eg, gender, equity, disability, poverty, sustainable development) democracy, governance, rule of law, non-discrimination) </li>
	<li>groups most at risk (eg, children, women, workers, migrants) </li>
	<li>specific rights and freedoms and corresponding duties and responsibilities (eg, health, education, food, housing, movement, life).</li>
</ul>

<p class="margin_bottom_20">The multiregional and multidisciplinary character of the Global Campus is integral to the initiative. Thus, contributions can have global, regional or local relevance; comparative perspectives are also welcome. Contributions can be multidisciplinary, interdisciplinary or from the perspective of any one of the arts, humanities and social sciences disciplines that enrich our networkâ€”including Law, International Relations, Sociology, Economics, Politics, Anthropology, History, Education, Health and the Arts.</p>

<p class="margin_bottom_20">Submissions are invited in English. To enhance accessibility, we would be pleased to receive a second version of the submission in a different language: the English-language version will be used for review and editing, but we shall upload both versions to the website. Our website has a search facility that allows readers to find submissions in languages other than English.</p>

<!-- <p class="margin_bottom_20">We also have an Announcements page, which you can use to inform our readers about a conference, recent publication or call for papers relevant to our focus on human rights preparedness.<p> -->
