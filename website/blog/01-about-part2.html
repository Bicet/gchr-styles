<p class="subtitle_page_programme">Goals and objectives</p>
<p class="margin_bottom_20">Drawing on the Global Campusâ€™ unique character, and complementing both its education mission and its broader commitment to advancing human rights and democracy, in a new way, <em>GC Human Rights Preparedness</em> has one goal and four objectives:</p>

<ul style="padding-left: 20px;margin-bottom: 20px;">
	<li class="margin_bottom_10"><strong>Our goal</strong>: To advance a rights-based approach to pandemics and other emergencies, ensuring that existing inequalities, which can be exacerbated in times of crisis, and the risk of disproportionate impact on marginalised or disadvantaged individuals and groups, are integrated from the outset.<br></li>
	<li><strong>Our objectives</strong>: (1) To share information via open source materials; (2) To chart and fill knowledge gaps with respect to persistent challenges and best practices, and to encourage deep reflection and bold thinking; (3) To demonstrate the value of the humanities and social sciences as essential companions to the sciences; and (4) To craft a resource of enduring value.</li>
