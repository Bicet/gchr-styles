<h3 class="title_page_programme titolo_gc_europe margin_bottom_40">Partnership pack</h3>
<p class="margin_bottom_20">We kindly invite you to participate as a Partner in our activities and events. This partnership provides a prestigious promotion opportunity for selected organizations. <br> The importance of Human Rights is paramount to this project and it is related to the United Nations (UN) 2030 Agenda that contained a call for partnerships to develop between governments, the private sector and civil society.</p>
<p class="margin_bottom_20">We are proposing inclusive partnerships that are built on a foundation of principles and values, a shared vision, common goals that prioritise people and the planet, and that are necessary at a global level. To successfully fulfil the UNâ€™s 2030 Agenda, we must move rapidly from commitments to actions.</p>
<p>This Partnership Pack provides many significant benefits and considerable visibility and exposure.</p>
