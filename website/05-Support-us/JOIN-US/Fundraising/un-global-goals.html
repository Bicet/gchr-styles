<p class="margin_bottom_20">The Global Campus overall objectives are:</p>
<ul class="lista_con_pallini margin_bottom_20">
	<li>Education: to develop the capacity of stakeholders to respond to current human rights and democracy concerns</li>
	<li>Research impact: to influence policies and practices on human rights and democratisation in national and international governance</li>
	<li>Outreach: to consolidate global collaborations to advance human rights and democracy through inter-regional networking</li>
</ul> 
<p class="margin_bottom_20">Since our foundation over 20 years ago we have engaged with public administration, civil society, human rights organisations, international governmental/multi-governmental and non-governmental organisations, academia and the research community.</p>
<p class="margin_bottom_20">We would like to initiate cooperation with partners who believe that EDUCATION CAN CHANGE THE WORLD. The encouragement we receive from our donors and members greatly contributes to the success of our global network.</p>
