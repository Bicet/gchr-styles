        <p class="title_accordion titolo_gc_south_east_europe">Why</p>
    </div>
    <div class="text_accordion">
        <p class="margin_bottom_20">The ERMA programme is a point of reference for the teaching of human rights and democratization at university level in the SEE area, and one of the pioneer EU projects in the higher education sector in the post-conflict regional dimension.</p>
        <p class="margin_bottom_20">In its 18 years of tradition, the programme has graduated over 500 human rights professionals, who rejoined their societies as agents of change.</p>
        <p class="margin_bottom_20">The uniqueness of the structure and teaching curricula gives the opportunity to students to gain interdisciplinary knowledge and expertise but also offers the chance to acquire working and research experience in most of the key regional NGOs, governmental institutions, think-tanks, and academic institutions.</p>
        <p class="margin_bottom_20">The courses on the methodology of academic research and writing, the assistance by the academic tutors and the intensive MA thesis field research and writing process, give a broad academic dimension to the programme, and allow students to develop the necessary skills of academic writing and research.</p>
        <p>For purposes of mobility, cultural diversity, and flexibility students spend 45 days at the University of Bologna Residential Center of Bertinoro, where they complete their theses and foster multicultural skills and adaptability while living together. Moreover, the programme attracts students, scholars, and experts from the region and beyond establishing a global network of human rights professionals producing fruitful professional cooperation and life- long friendships among its graduates.</p>
