<p class="margin_bottom_20">ERMA Alumni Network (EAN) is the official action which links more than 530 graduates of the programme (as per a. y. 2018/19) to its alma mater, and vice versa. EAN is established to represent the point of reference for the communication with the former students, and a tool through which the ERMA programme can foster a web of professional, academic and public relations with its graduates, in a systematic and organized manner. </p>
<p class="margin_bottom_20">EAN is funded by the ERMA programme and it is part of the <a href="https://globalcampusalumni.org/" class="titolo_gc_south_east_europe" target="_blank">Global Campus Alumni (GCA)</a>, the international organization created by the <a href="/" class="titolo_gc_south_east_europe" target="_blank">Global Campus of Human Rights</a> to gather the alumni associations and networks of the regional master programmes all over the world. The members of the EAN are all the graduates of the programme from the academic year 2000/01, who acquire member status upon completing their studies and obtaining the double diploma.</p>
<p class="margin_bottom_20">EAN work is focused on the areas of connecting, engaging, and networking of its alumni body. Through projects in the field of the (1) connecting, EAN ensures continuous networking of its members, thus forming a global network of skilled human rights and democratization experts. In this sense, EAN acts as an important interlocutor in the communication and information-sharing among the graduates and facilitates various networking opportunities. The (2) engagement of the alumni, on the other hand, gives the alumni quality opportunities to get involved in the activities of the ERMA Programme and the GC and their alumni networks, respectively. Finally, alumni (3) empowerment means that through its activities, EAN boosts alumni skills, expertise, and visibility and at the same increases their employability and self-employability. By empowering its graduates and reconnecting with their <em>alma mater</em>, EAN also contributes to the academic development of the Programme.</p>
