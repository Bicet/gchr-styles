            <p class="subtitle_page_programme margin_bottom_20">Nick Danziger</p>
            <p class="margin_bottom_20">Inspired by a taste for adventure and by the comic strip reporter Tintin, Nick Danziger took off alone on his first trip to Paris in 1971 aged 13. Subsequent journeys took Nick further afield; to South and Central America, the Middle and Far East, as well as Africa.</p>
            <div class="text_read_more">
                <p class="margin_bottom_20">Nick's initial ambition was to be an artist. He graduated with an MA and taught art school and was represented by a gallery. But his desire to travel remained, becoming more and more interested in people’s daily lives, often living and working side by side with people living in the margins of society be it in Afghanistan, Colombia, Mongolia, Kosovo, Ethiopia and Great Britain.</p>
                <p class="margin_bottom_20">He has worked amongst traumatized populations living in war zones and in neighbourhoods undermined by social conflicts. For Danziger photography, writing and documentary filmmaking are all means for capturing and recording what he sees. His first documentary film, War, Lives and Videotape, based on children abandoned in the Marstoon mental asylum on the outskirts of Kabul won the Prix Italia for best television documentary film and he is a winner of a World Press Award in the single best portrait category for his ‘mirror image’ of Tony Blair and George Bush as they went to war in Iraq in April 2003.</p>
