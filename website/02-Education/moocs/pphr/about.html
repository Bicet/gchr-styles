<!-- MAIN CONTENT -->
<p class="margin_bottom_20">Human rights are an inherent part of every individual. They are the outcome of long struggles and achievements. Responding to the necessity to counter - and in the future prevent - the tragic effects of genocide, war, economic depression, nationalism and colonialism, they were engraved in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights as "a common standard of achievement for all peoples and all nations". Then, they carried the hope for freedom, justice and peace in the world. Today, they are often questioned, attacked, dismissed and violated. But they still stand to remind us that “we are all born equal and free in dignity and rights”.</p>
<p class="margin_bottom_20">Promoting and protecting human rights is yet a work in progress. Much still needs to be done, but we can build on the concrete improvements and achievements that human rights have already allowed over the years. We can defend cases, advocate for change and bring about progress on the basis of legal instruments and mechanisms: laws, institutions, courts. We can face challenges with the strength of the benefits that have been demonstrated around the world: greater freedom and democracy; better health, education, and standards of living. To continue our efforts, we need information, education, awareness and action. This course provides you with a solid basis to understand, know and stand up for human rights.</p>

<p class="margin_bottom_20">In this light, the UN Global Study commissioned to Prof. Manfred Nowak is an opportunity to raise awareness about the manifold challenges in this area and to:</p>
<ul class="number_list margin_bottom_20">
    <li>Assess the magnitude of the occurrence of children deprived of liberty;</li>
    <li>Document good practices and capture the views and experiences of these children;</li>
    <li>Promote a change in stigmatizing attitudes and behaviour towards children at risk of being, or who are, deprived of liberty;</li>
    <li>Provide recommendations for law, policy and practice to safeguard the human rights of the children concerned.</li>
</ul>
<p class="margin_bottom_20">To amplify the impact of the Study, this MOOC will offer the opportunity to gain insights on the research, collection, analysis, and final elaboration of information related to specific areas and cross-cutting themes.</p>

    </div>
    <div class="text_accordion">
        <p class="margin_bottom_20">The course is articulated in 2 modules: the first one (two classes) is recommended for all participants, while the second one (5 classes) is elective and can be composed of minimum 1 and maximum 5 classes, for a total of maximum 7 classes.</p>
        <p class="margin_bottom_20"><strong>Module 1</strong> focuses on the international framework of human rights promotion and protection. In particular, it summarily explains standards, mechanisms, benefits and challenges in the current set up, especially at the United Nations level.</p>
        <p class="margin_bottom_20"><strong>Module 2</strong>  is dedicated to regional perspectives on the standards, mechanisms, benefits and challenges in five regions of the world: Africa, the Americas, the Arab World, Asia Pacific, and Europe. In so doing, it specifically analyses the links with the international framework and the distinctive features of each geographical area. </p>

        <p class="margin_bottom_20">Upon completion of this course participants will have gained:</p>
        <ul class="lista_con_pallini margin_bottom_20">
            <li>Knowledge about key historical, philosophical and legal developments</li>
            <li>Understanding of progress and obstacles (overtime and current) </li>
            <li>Ability to identify multi-faceted aspects (pros and cons)</li>

    </div>
    <div class="text_accordion">
        <p class="margin_bottom_20">The course is modelled on a flexible structure whereby the first Module (two classes) is general and the same for all participants, while the second Module (five classes) is composed of regional courses that can be selected by participants on the basis of their interests. For each class, participants are expected to engage in approximately 5 hours of active learning through readings, videos, and quizzes.
        <br>The ideal time for completion would be around 7 weeks (one week per class) for a total of 35 hours, but it could take less or more depending on the pace that each participant sets for it. <!-- [Twice a year the MOOC will be offered in instructor-led mode, with the addition of fora for course discussions.]  -->Examples from different areas of the world and on different themes allow the identification of cross-regional and cross-cutting issues and enable a global and multidimensional understanding of the topic. </p>

    <div class="text_accordion">
        <p class="margin_bottom_20">Given the flexible nature of the MOOC, it would be complex to issue a certificate for each varying degree and level of completion. For this reason, we give you the possibility to either audit the course to the extent that you wish or earn a certificate of participation upon completion of all 7 classes. If you decide to audit the course, you will not receive a certificate, but you can print your progress page if you want evidence of your achievement. </p>
        <p class="margin_bottom_20">If you would like or need to have official proof that you have completed this MOOC, we offer you the option of requesting a Certificate of Completion with a Transcript of Records. In order to do so, you will have to successfully complete and pass all the 7 Classes of the course and related Quizzes.</p>
