<p class="margin_bottom_20">Three structural “Human Rights Studies & Training Programmes” have been developed to forge a team of human rights scholars, researchers and junior practitioners who will constitute the backbone of the Human Rights Centre. They will be equipped with knowledge, tools and skills to conceptualise and lead courses, research and learning activities that will become a new area of expertise for the UNTL. In addition, selected beneficiaries of the training programmes will be teaching a new compulsory undergraduate course in human rights to be introduced across all nine UNTL Faculties in 2021.</p>
