<p class="subtitle_page_programme">Enrolment</p>
<p class="margin_bottom_20">The enrolment of the selected participants will be made on a "first come first served" basis. We therefore invite you to proceed as soon as possible to ensure a place in the programme.</p>
<p class="margin_bottom_20">The enrolment will only be final with the confirmation that the payment of the fee has been received by the secretariat, therefore we kindly ask you to send a scanned copy of the international bank transfer to <a class="titolo_gc_europe" href="mailto:chra@gchumanrights.org">chra@gchumanrights.org</a></p>
<p>All participants attending the school will receive a certificate of participation upon completion of the programme.</p>
<!--<p class="margin_bottom_20">Please note that Global Campus of Human Rights does not offer scholarships at this point in time. We encourage all participants to investigate possible sponsorships, such as Erasmus+ funding, through national or international organisations, ngos and academic institutions.</p>-->
