<p class="subtitle_page_programme">Applicant Requiring Visas</p>
<p class="margin_bottom_20">Non-EU applicants require a Visa to access Italy.<br> Students requiring Visas usually need to produce an official letter of invitation from the school to the Visa Application Centre. As these are only issued upon receipt of full payment, we encourage non-EU applicants to apply to the summer school with adequate advance and with full payment. Following notification of admission, the school will provide you with an invitation letter confirming that you are offered a place in the programme and the fees are paid.</p>
<p class="margin_bottom_20">Visa application process can take several months: we strongly recommend applicants to apply as soon as they receive the invitation letter from the Summer School in order to appeal any refusals.</p>
