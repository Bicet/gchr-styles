The 10-day programme provides a safe, culturally rich and collaborative environment where diversity and inclusivity are embraced, original and critical thinking is encouraged, skills are honed, creativity is unleashed and networking with experts from the human rights arena and professionals from the film industry at the <a class="titolo_gc_europe" href="http://www.labiennale.org/en/cinema/" target="_blank">78<sup>th</sup> Venice international Film Festival</a> is supported.</p>
<p class="margin_bottom_20">This year’s programme is focusing on ‘delivering social change to children and young people’ in the broader framework of human rights protection and promotion. The school is designed to appeal to young professionals from diverse backgrounds and experiences.</p>
<p class="margin_bottom_20">This year the Summer School programme will be delivered in a blended format with online and in presence sessions in Venice Lido, both at the Global Campus and the Venice International Film Festival venues.</p>
<p>The Global Campus of Human Rights launched the summer school programme in 2005. It was meant to be a one-off event; nevertheless, given its success, the summer school ran for another four years in Venice before moving in 2010 to the Huston School of Film [&amp;] Digital Media (part of the National University of Ireland in Galway), where it flourished for additional six years. Since 2017, the Summer School is back to its birthplace in Venice Lido.</p>
