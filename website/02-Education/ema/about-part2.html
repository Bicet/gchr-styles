Her doctoral dissertation examined the role, function and adequacy of public international law to deal with civilians’ access to, enjoyment and progressive realization of economic, social and cultural rights as controversially affected during and in the aftermath of contemporary scenarios of armed conflict and contexts of occupied territories. Particular attention was devoted to the normative responses advanced under international humanitarian law, in tandem with the functional development of other applicable international legal regimes such as international criminal law and international human rights law.</p>
