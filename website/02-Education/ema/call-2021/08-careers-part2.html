<p class="subtitle_page_programme">EMA Internship Programme</p>
<p class="margin_bottom_20">Every year since 1998/1999, EIUC and now the Global Campus of Human Rights, with the support of the European Union, has awarded a paid internship in the field of human rights to the 15 students who have achieved the highest results during each academic year. Internships in inter-governmental, governmental and non-governmental organisations have given the selected graduates an opportunity to immediately put into practice the knowledge acquired during the course.</p>

    <p class="margin_bottom_20">The EMA Internship Programme has already offered a unique opportunity to over 200 graduates to access the job market. It is in fact an excellent way to transition into a working career, having become a platform for many generations of students that are now employed or have been employed within the organisations where they have interned thanks to EIUC. It has also helped creating a powerful alumni network that has become instrumental in facilitating interaction between different institutions.</p>
    <p class="margin_bottom_20"><em>The EMA Internship Programme in the EC Delegation in Beijing was another fantastic experience and while working in China, as well as in every place I have worked since including Brussels, Darfur, Democratic Republic of Congo and Sierra Leone, I was lucky enough to befriend new masterini and to feel part of a truly global network. <br>(Matthew Willner-Reid, EMA Graduate 2005/2006, Cooperation Officer for Services to Vulnerable Populations, EU Delegation in Kabul)</em></p>
