<p class="subtitle_page_programme">Mission</p>
<p class="margin_bottom_20">EMA’s academic excellence in teaching, research and practical training is a testament to the spirit shared by professors, experts, students and staff: genuine dedication to the advancement of global values and human dignity through inter-university cooperation, interdisciplinarity and an action-oriented approach. In order to achieve these aims, the programme successfully combines two objectives: on the one hand, to provide a solid theoretical preparation and, on the other hand, to offer a good understanding of the operational requirements and challenges of practical work.</p>
<p class="margin_bottom_10">Specifically, EMA was established with the following aims:</p>
<ul class="lista_con_pallini">
	<li>To educate high-level professionals in the field of human rights and democratisation qualified to work as academics, staff members or field workers for inter-governmental, governmental, and non-governmental organisations;</li>
	<li>To provide its graduates with both a solid theoretical understanding of issues related to human rights and democratisation and with operational skills enabling them to perform practical work in this area;</li>
	<li>To create and maintain a European network of curriculum development and staff exchange among universities in the field of human rights and democratisation.</li>
</ul>
<p>The growing number of EMA graduates (more than 1800 so far) and their careers reflect the far-reaching impact of EMA: a source of inspiration and the creator of a community of competent specialists working in the field of human rights and democratisation at the local, regional, national, international level both in the governmental and non-governmental sectors as well as in academia.</p>
