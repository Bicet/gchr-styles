<p class="subtitle_page_programme">GCA Mentoring Programme</p>
<p class="margin_bottom_20">The Global Campus Alumni Association runs a mentoring programme aimed to connect alumni with more experienced human rights professionals for support, advice and exchange of fresh ideas. The Programme provides open space for alumni interested in receiving guidance on their professional and personal development, as well as for human rights experts keen on building their coaching skills and supporting and inspiring fellow alumni to fulfil their potential.Â Since 2012, over 220 mentors and mentees have participated and benefited from this opportunity.</p>
