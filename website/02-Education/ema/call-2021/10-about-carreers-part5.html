            <p class="margin_bottom_20">The majority of EMA graduates work with human rights organisations (governmental and non-governmental, international and national) both at their headquarters and in field missions (e.g. electoral observation, human rights monitoring, international cooperation projects). A number of graduates are also involved in human rights-related activities with their Ministries of Foreign Affairs or are seconded by them to work for international institutions. Some graduates pursue further academic studies and research and a few are now the representatives of some EMA participating universities.</p>
          
                <p class="margin_bottom_20">The Global Campus itself has facilitated the entry of its graduates into the human rights job market through two successful programmes:</p>
                <ul class="margin_bottom_20">
                    <li><span style="font-weight: 400;">EMA Internship Programme</span><br>Every year the EMA programme, with the support of the European Union, awards a paid internship in the field of human rights to the 15 graduates who achieved the highest results during their academic year. These internships in inter-governmental, governmental and non-governmental organisations give the selected graduates an opportunity to immediately put into practice the knowledge acquired during the course.</li>
                    <li><span style="font-weight: 400;">GC EU-UN Fellowship Programme</span><br>The EU-UN Fellowship Programme complements the training activities of EMA by providing high level operational working experience for 4 EMA graduates each year. This unique programme was initiated in 1996 by the Human Rights and Democratisation Unit of the European Commission and has since gained an excellent reputation and appreciation for the practical assistance that the fellows provide and the exceptional experience that the fellows gain.</li>
