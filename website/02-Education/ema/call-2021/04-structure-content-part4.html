<p class="subtitle_page_programme">Second Semester</p>
<p class="margin_bottom_20">During the EMA second semester students relocate to one of the 42 participating universities to follow courses in an area of specialisation of their own choice and to undertake personal supervised research finalised in the writing of their master‘s thesis. In the second semester, students must take at least two courses for a total of 9 ECTS credits. The second semester mark accounts for the 15% of the master’s final mark.</p>

<p class="margin_bottom_20">The second semester is conceived as a European exchange, which means that students will be hosted in a university located in a country other than their own. During the first half of the first semester, students define individual thesis topics on the basis of which suitable EMA universities to host these studies are identified. This process is carried out by the EMA Academic Team according to an established format. The maximum number of students that can be hosted by each participating university is three.</p>

<p>Students are allocated to their second semester university taking into account both the student's and the university's interest, the suitability of the thesis topic for the respective department and the quality of the thesis proposal. The decision is made by the EMA Executive Council (in consultation with the EMA Council) in December and is final and binding.</p>
