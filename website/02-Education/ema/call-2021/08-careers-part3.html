<p class="subtitle_page_programme">GC EU-UN Fellowship Programme</p>
<p class="margin_bottom_20">The EU-UN Fellowship Programme complements the training activities of EMA by providing high-level operational working experience for four EMA graduates each year. This unique programme was initiated in 1996 by the Human Rights and Democratisation Unit of the European Commission and has since gained an excellent reputation and appreciation for the assistance that the fellows provide and the exceptional experience that the fellows gain.</p>
<div class="text_read_more"><br>
<p class="margin_bottom_20">As the fellows are assigned to the EU Delegations to the United Nations (Geneva and New York), the programme provides EMA graduates with an opportunity to gain advanced insight into EU activities at the UN, thus creating a multiplier effect for future work experiences. At the same time, it boosts the human resources capacity of EU offices by providing them with young professionals who possess specific expertise in the promotion of human rights.</p>
<p class="margin_bottom_20">The fellows become an integral part of the delegation, acting (under due supervision) as human rights experts, providing helpful support and information on human rights issues, and gaining extensive insight into diplomatic activities.</p>
<p class="margin_bottom_20"><em>Through GC I had the opportunity to participate in the GC Fellowship Programme, at the United Nations. I spent five months in Geneva working with the EU presidency at the Human Rights Commission, and four months in New York at the European Commission delegation to the UN. It was an amazing experience, I had the chance to draft speeches which I delivered at the Council, participate in EU/UN negotiations, meet with NGOs. Ultimately it gave the opportunity to put into practice so much what we had studied throughout the Master's programme.Â  <br>(Jean Tomkin, E.MA graduate 2006/2007, Solicitor in one of Ireland's largest Criminal Law and Human Rights Practices)</em></p>
