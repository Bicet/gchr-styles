        <p class="margin_bottom_20">Teaching happens through formal lectures and practical exercises. Emphasis is placed on classroom participation. The study visits provide an excellent opportunity for students to interact with international experts who make a personal contribution to the general experience. Throughout the first semester, each student is assigned to a ‘clinical group’ which works on a practical human rights or democratisation issue with clear objectives and outcomes which forms part of the assessment. </p>
        <p class="margin_bottom_10">Students are placed within the following units for the human rights clinic.</p>
