<ul class="lista_con_pallini margin_bottom_20">
    <li><em>The Helen Kanzira Memorial Lecture</em> is presented annually and memorialises one of the pioneer students of the Master’s in Human Rights and Democratisation in Africa (HRDA) programme who passed away as a result of pregnancy-related complications. The lecture provides a platform for assessing the situation of reproductive health rights of women in Africa.</li>
    <li><em>The Julius Osega Memorial Lecture</em> remembers the life of one of the graduates of the Centre’s Master’s degree in Human Rights and Democratisation in Africa (HRDA). The annual lecture is organised by the Centre for Human Rights, University of Pretoria, together with one or more of its partners on the HRDA programme.  Julius was a student on the programme in 2001, the second year the programme was running. Sadly, Julius was killed in 2008, during a civilian patrol in the Darfur region of Sudan. At the time, Julius was part of the African Union/UN Hybrid operation in Darfur (UNAMID) forces, deployed to protect civilians and assist the political process in the country.</li>
