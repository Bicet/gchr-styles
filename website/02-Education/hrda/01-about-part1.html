<p class="margin_bottom_20">The <strong>LLM/MPhil in Human Rights and Democratisation in Africa (HRDA)</strong> is a prestigious one-year course where 25-30 exceptional individuals spend six months in Pretoria and six months at one of the 12 partner universities all over Africa. They are taught by eminent lecturers in the field of human rights and undergo many practical training exercises. It is the only course of its kind in Africa.</p>
<p class="margin_bottom_20">The HRDA Master’s programme is connected with the other six Global Campus’ regional Master’s programmes through lecturer exchanges and participation in common global activities targeting both faculty and students.</p>
