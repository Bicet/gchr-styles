<p class="margin_bottom_20">The LLM/MPhil in Human Rights and Democratisation in Africa (HRDA) is a prestigious one-year intensive course where 25-30 exceptional individuals spend six months in Pretoria and six months at one of the <a href="https://www.chr.up.ac.za/hrda-partner-universities" class="titolo_gc_africa">12 partner universities</a> all over Africa. They are taught by eminent lecturers in the field of human rights and undergo many practical training exercises. It is the only course of its kind in Africa. Graduates become members of the HRDA Alumni whose 537 members are currently active in the full spectrum of human rights work: from grassroots, to the civil service in their respective countries, to international organisations including the African Union and the United Nations. Since the pioneers completed the programme in December 2000, class or country networks have been established and exist informally.</p>
<p class="margin_bottom_20">This country networks were officially formulated into one association during the Alumni Conference which took place at the University of Pretoria on 10 December 2009. Since then, the Alumni has gone on to celebrate its 20th anniversary with a three-day programme from 8 – 10 December 2019. The celebration which included a symposium, the launch of the newly published Alumni Diaries and other events further keyed into the core objective  of the Graduate programme as the LLM/MPhil HRDA Alumni were able to forge new partnerships and synergise towards a more formidable group of vanguards for human rights education in Africa and beyond.
