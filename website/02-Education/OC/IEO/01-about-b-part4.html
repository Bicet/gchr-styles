            <p class="margin_bottom_20">International election observation plays an important role in international relations since almost thirty years. The <a href="https://www.ndi.org/sites/default/files/1923_declaration_102705_0.pdf" class="titolo_gc_europe" target="_blank">Declaration of Principles for International Election Observation</a> adopted by the UN in 2005 is one of the first attempts of the international community to set standard rules which are recognised at international level. The European Union is strongly committed to contribute to all democratic processes around the world through various activities, including electoral observation. The adoption of EU guidelines on preconditions for EU observation missions and a code of conduct for EU electoral observers represent an important step towards enhanced co-ordination and serve as a basis for all electoral observers. The 2005 Declaration and the Code of Conduct set a common framework, methodology, standards and best practices valid for all observers both at national (domestic) and international level.
