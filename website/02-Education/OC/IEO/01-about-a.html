    <p class="margin_bottom_20">International election observation plays an important role in international relations since almost thirty years. The <a href="https://www.ndi.org/sites/default/files/1923_declaration_102705_0.pdf" target="_blank" class="titolo_gc_europe">Declaration of Principles for International Election Observation</a> adopted by the UN in 2005 is one of the first attempts of the international community to set up standard rules recognized at international level. The European Union is strongly committed to contribute to all democratic processes around the world through various activities which include the electoral observation. The adoption of <a href="http://www.eods.eu/template/default/files/EU_guidelines_on_criteria_forselection_observers.pdf" target="_blank" class="titolo_gc_europe">EU guidelines on preconditions for EU observation missions</a> and a <a href="https://eeas.europa.eu/sites/eeas/files/code_of_conduct_for_eu_election_observers.pdf" target="_blank" class="titolo_gc_europe">code of conduct for EU electoral observers</a> represent an important step towards enhanced co-ordination and serve as a basis for all electoral observers. The 2005 Declaration and the Code of Conduct set a common framework, methodology, standards and best practices valid for all observers both at national (domestic) and international level.</p>
    
    <p class="margin_bottom_20">The Global Campus of Human Rights has developed a course aiming at providing training to civilian staff in election observation missions at the start of their career (i.e. short term observers). Selected applicants will become aware of the role, tasks and status of international observers, and will be given a theoretical and practical training on election observation and election observation missions functioning.</p>
    <div class="text_read_more"><br>
        <p class="margin_bottom_20">Open and legitimate elections are the indispensable foundation for sustainable development and effective democracy. Actions supporting the right to participate in genuine elections can play a major role in sustaining peace, security and conflict prevention. Support takes the form of electoral assistance projects and election observation missions. This requires skilled and trained observers.</p>
        <p class="margin_bottom_20">Since 2012 the Global Campus has trained more than 400 short term observers through its onsite courses in Venice Lido. The training has received the patronage of the <a href="{{link_url::602}}" class="titolo_gc_europe">Ministries of Foreign Affairs of Italy, Czech Republic and Spain</a>, the support of <a href="https://eeas.europa.eu/topics/election-observation-missions-eueoms_en?page=1" target="_blank" class="titolo_gc_europe">European External Action Service</a> (EEAS) and the <a href="https://www.osce.org/odihr" target="_blank" class="titolo_gc_europe">Office for Democratic Institutions and Human Rights</a> (ODHIR), thus reinforcing its already well established international recognition and validating its value for actual field work.</p>
        <p class="margin_bottom_20">Given the current Covid-19 pandemic, a brand new online edition of the course has been designed to offer to selected participants a very rewarding, engaging and challenging experience in distance learning education.</p>
