It is specifically aimed at training civilian staff in election observation missions at the start of their career (i.e. short term observers). Selected applicants will become aware of the role, tasks and status of international observers, and will be given a theoretical and practical training on election observation and election observation missions functioning. The course also provides thorough knowledge of international legal standards, observation methodology and missions functioning that might be of interest to political experts, analysts, journalists, consultants and researchers.</p>
