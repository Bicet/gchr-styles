<p class="margin_bottom_20">The EIUC human resources’ structure presents the specific features of an umbrella/coordinating institution which is not embedded in one specific university, but operates as general secretariat providing services to all its “decentralized” partners.</p>
<p class="margin_bottom_20">To do so EIUC’s staff:</p>
<ul class="lista_con_pallini margin_bottom_20">
<li>Services the Global Campus, for which the Centre functions as hub and administrative coordinator.</li>
<li>Operates as an academic and research centre providing premises, academic structures, project management and financial services to the Master’s Programme in Human Rights and Democratisation (EMA / Global Campus Europe) as well as to the additional educational, training and research activities, which enrich its portfolio.</li>
</ul>
<p>The EIUC staff is organised in 6 departments, with the EIUC Secretary General as the apical position (supported by a Personal Secretary), and with the Administrative Director acting as intermediate management position between the Secretary General and the Heads of Department. One department reports directly to the Secretary General (Academic / EMA Department), while the other six departments (Global Campus, Projects, Finances, Fundraising /PR/Communication, Premises and Technical Services, and General Services) report via the Administrative Manager.</p>
