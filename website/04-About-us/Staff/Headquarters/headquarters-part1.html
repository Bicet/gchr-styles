<p class="subtitle_page_programme">Headquarters Staff</p>
<p class="margin_bottom_20">The HQ presents the specific features of an umbrella organisation which operates as a general secretariat and administrative coordinator of its member universities. The headquarter staff provides these partners with financial, logistic, communication, research and outreach assistance.</p>
<p class="margin_bottom_20">The HQ also functions as an administrative, academic and research centre for the Master’s Programme in Human Rights and Democratisation (EMA / Global Campus Europe). Finally, it delivers project management and financial services for additional educational and training activities that take place in Venice and online.</p>

We further cooperate with the European Centre for Constitutional and Human Rights in order to strategically defend the rights of children.</p>
