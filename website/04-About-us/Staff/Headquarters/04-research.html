Podstawa) FRAME Deliverable 14.2 2016, which focused on three crisis situations affecting human rights in EU policies and included case studies on Hungary and Poland, Turkey, and Ukraine.

Since 2018, Chiara has been appointed as one of the lead researchers of the research group related to ‘children living in places of detention with their imprisoned parents in the context of the criminal justice system’, which is one of the six key areas of the United Nations Global Study on Children Deprived of Liberty led by the Independent Expert Manfred Nowak.

She was a visiting research scholar at the Center for International and Comparative Law of the University of Michigan Law School in Ann Arbor. Her doctoral dissertation examined the role, function and adequacy of public international law to deal with civilians’ access to, enjoyment and progressive realization of economic, social and cultural rights as controversially affected during and in the aftermath of contemporary scenarios of armed conflict and contexts of occupied territories. Particular attention was devoted to the normative responses advanced under international humanitarian law, in tandem with the functional development of other applicable international legal regimes, such as international criminal law and international human rights law..</p>
