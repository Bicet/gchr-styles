They are crucial human resources at a time when our world is increasingly confronted with crises and challenges to human rights.</p>

        <p>Not only does the ces offer a comprehensive one-year academic course, but also provides a lifetime access to a supportive community of vanguard human rights professionals and a pool of invaluable opportunities for career and personal development. The skills and experience I gained through the Global Campus internship programme (internship at the Council of Europe-Directorate for Human Rights and Rule of Law) has had a major impact on shaping my global perspective and has equipped me with the right tools to fight global challenges locally.</p>
