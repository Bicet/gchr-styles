<p class="margin_bottom_40">Through the European Instrument for Democracy and Human Rights (EIDHR) the EU is the primary funder of the Global Campus, previously known as the European Inter-University Centre for Human Rights and Democratisation. Education, training and research have always been key elements of EU policy on human rights and democratisation. Accordingly, in 1997 the European Parliament and the European Commission supported the establishment of the European Master’s Degree Programme in Human Rights and Democratisation (EMA) and subsequently also other regional master’s programmes (HRDA in 2000, ERMA in 2001, APMA and CES in 2010, LATMA in 2011 and ARMA in 2015). </p>

<p class="margin_bottom_40">On 1<sup>st</sup> August 2019 the <a href="https://www.rightlivelihoodaward.org" class="titolo_gc_europe">Right Livelihood Foundation</a> and the Global Campus of Human Rights entered a long-term cooperation agreement on human rights education with a particular focus on the promotion and strengthening of children’s rights. Its purpose is to strengthen the values of human and children’s rights, democracy and the rule of law, while linking human rights with the other overarching goals of the United Nations, namely peace, development and a sustainable environment. Established in 1980, the Right Livelihood Foundation honours and supports courageous people and organisations who offer visionary and exemplary solutions to the root causes of global problems. The award it presents is widely known as the 'Alternative Nobel Prize'</p>
