<p class="subtitle_page_programme">Governance</p>
<p class="margin_bottom_20">The Global Campus of Human Rights is an international network for education, training and research in human rights and democratisation mainly funded by the EU. The origins of the Global Campus date back to a pioneering initiative of the European Commission and Prof. Antonio Papisca of the University of Padova. In 1997, with the support of 10 universities, they established the European Master in Human Rights and Democratisation (<span class="maiuscoletto">EMA</span>). In 2002, participating universities from all EU Member States formally established the European Inter-University Centre for Human Rights (<span class="maiuscoletto">EIUC</span>), a non-profit association under Italian law based in Venice. In parallel, similar Master’s Programmes funded by the European Union were established in six other regions (Africa, South East Europe, Asia-Pacific, Latin America and the Caribbean, the Caucasus Region and the Arab World). In each region one university took the coordinating role. In 2012, the European Commission requested EIUC to become the umbrella organisation for all <a href="about-us/global-campus-of-human-rights/universities.html" class="titolo_gc_europe">regional Master’s Programmes</a> in partnership with the coordinating universities.</p>
<p class="margin_bottom_20">After a gradual process of transformation, in February 2019 the <span class="maiuscoletto">EIUC</span> Assembly revised the organisation’s <a href="https://gchumanrights.org/about-us/documents-of-reference.html" class="titolo_gc_europe">statute</a> and changed its name to ‘Global Campus of Human Rights’, to reflect the global nature of its composition and governance. At the first meeting of the enlarged Global Campus Assembly, held in Pretoria in December 2019, the <span class="maiuscoletto">EIUC</span> Administrative Board was replaced by the Global Campus Council, consisting of 15 members from all regions.</p>
<p class="margin_bottom_20">Of the roughly 100 universities participating in the seven Master’s Programmes, a total of 74 have so far become full members of the Global Campus. Our governing structure is thus a true example of global governance.</p>
<p class="margin_bottom_20"><strong>Governing Bodies</strong></p>
<p class="margin_bottom_20">As laid out in its Statute, the Global Campus is governed by the Assembly, the Council, the President, the Vice-President(s), the Honorary President(s), the Secretary General, an Advisory Board and a Statutory Auditor. These statutory bodies are assisted by specialised working groups such as the Academic Affairs Committee, the Working Group on Budgetary Issues and the Working Group on the Global Campus Vision.</p>
