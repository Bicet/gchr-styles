<p class="subtitle_page_programme"> “A world in which human dignity, freedom, democracy, equality, the rule of law and respect of human rights, as shared values of the EU and UN and as internationally binding legal standards, are fully realized”	</p>
<p class="margin_bottom_20">These values are fundamental for all human beings and essential to the sustainable development of all nations. The Global Campus recognizes them as interdependent and indivisible.</p>
<p class="margin_bottom_20">Human dignity stands first as an all-encompassing principle. Under the Charter of the United Nations (1945) and the Universal Declaration of Human Rights (1948), "the recognition of the inherent dignity and of the equal and inalienable rights of all members of the human family is the foundation of freedom, justice and peace in the world".</p>
<p class="margin_bottom_20"><strong>Values (first!)</strong></p>
<p class="margin_bottom_20">Human dignity, freedom, democracy, equality, the rule of law, and respect of human rights are fundamental values for all human beings and societies, and essential to the sustainable development of all nations.</p>
<p class="margin_bottom_20">Our vision recognizes them as equally essential and interconnected. They are the principles which constitute the foundation of human rights, which are in turn interdependent and indivisible.</p>
<p class="margin_bottom_20">Human dignity stands first as all-encompassing principle. As provided by the Charter of the United Nations (1945) and by the Universal Declaration of Human Rights (1948) "the recognition of the inherent dignity and of the equal and inalienable rights of all members of the human family is the foundation of freedom, justice and peace in the world".</p>
<p class="margin_bottom_20"><strong>(shared) Values</strong></p>
<p class="margin_bottom_20">As the biggest human rights education network in the world, EIUC / GC facilitates the dissemination of the mentioned universal values - human dignity, freedom, democracy, equality, the rule of law and respect for human rights - which are also core principles guiding the EU as a global player.</p>
<p class="margin_bottom_20">As shared universal and regional values they are best advanced through global cooperation. All regions have valuable perspectives to offer on their promotion and protection around the world.</p>
<p class="margin_bottom_20"><strong>(binding and fully realized) Values</strong></p>
<p class="margin_bottom_20">Human dignity, freedom, democracy, equality, the rule of law, and respect of human rights are not abstract concepts. They have been translated over the past decades into international binding norms, forming the international code of human rights and need to be preserved, enforced, put in practice every day.</p>
<p>Students, Alumni, scholars, professors, experts, staff forming the EIUC / Global Campus community are – first and foremost - human rights activists, and share an interdisciplinary and practice-oriented approach to education, training and research on human rights and democratisation.</p>
