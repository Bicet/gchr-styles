<p class="subtitle_page_programme">Dignity, Freedom, Democracy, Equality, Rule of Law, Respect of Human Rights.</p>
<!-- <p class="margin_bottom_20">EIUC and the Global Campus have joined forces to elaborate a shared vision (and mission) which shall guide the organisation until 2020 and beyond. A living document and source of inspiration for the whole network</p>
<p class="margin_bottom_20">The shared vision the European Inter-University Centre for Human Rights and Democratisation / Global Campus of Human Rights is:</p> -->
<p class="margin_bottom_20"><em>“A world in which human dignity, freedom, democracy, equality, the rule of law and respect of human rights, as shared values of the EU and UN and as internationally binding legal standards, are fully realized”</em></p>
<!-- <p class="margin_bottom_20"><strong>Values (first!)</strong></p> -->
<p class="margin_bottom_20">These values are fundamental for all human beings and essential to the sustainable development of all nations. The Global Campus recognizes them as interdependent and indivisible.</p>
<!-- <p class="margin_bottom_20">Our vision recognizes them as equally essential and interconnected. They are the principles which constitute the foundation of human rights, which are in turn interdependent and indivisible.</p> -->
<p class="margin_bottom_20">Human dignity stands first as all-encompassing principle. As provided by the Charter of the United Nations (1945) and by the Universal Declaration of Human Rights (1948) "the recognition of the inherent dignity and of the equal and inalienable rights of all members of the human family is the foundation of freedom, justice and peace in the world".</p>
<!-- <p class="margin_bottom_20"><strong>(shared) Values</strong></p> -->
<p class="margin_bottom_20">Human dignity, freedom, democracy, equality, the rule of law and respect for human rights are best advanced through global cooperation. All regions have valuable perspectives to offer on their promotion and protection around the world.</p>
<p class="margin_bottom_20">These values are not abstract concepts. They have been translated over the past decades into international binding norms, forming the international code of human rights, and they need to be preserved, enforced and put into practice every day.</p>
<!-- <p class="margin_bottom_20"><strong>(binding and fully realized) Values</strong></p> -->
<p class="margin_bottom_20">The students, alumni, scholars, experts and staff who form the Global Campus community are first and foremost human rights activists. They share an interdisciplinary and practice-oriented approach to education, training and research on human rights and democratisation.</p>
