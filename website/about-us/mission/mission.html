<p class="subtitle_page_programme">To act as a strategic hub for the advancement, interconnection and coordination of key resources and expertise in the area of human rights in all regions of the world</p>
<p class="margin_bottom_20">The mission of the Global Campus is to become a strategic hub for promoting, connecting and coordinating experts in the area of human rights in all regions of the world. Through higher education, training, research, outreach and specialised advice we aim to contribute to sustainable peace, justice and development. This is achieved by working with stakeholders at the governmental, inter-governmental and civil society levels; and by strengthening the regional and global dimensions of human rights and democracy.</p>
<p class="margin_bottom_20">We build on two decades of excellence in education, training and research in human rights and democratisation as an EU-supported Global Campus of about 100 leading universities. The Global Campus experience is distinguished by: interdisciplinary insights, cross-cultural exchanges, a wider range of participants and partners, international mobility, global network opportunities, and the unwavering determination to shape a world culture of human rights. We have trained and supported generations of human rights advocates and defenders, governmental and non-governmental officers, academics and civil servants across the world. We are proud of our worldwide network of more than 3000 alumni. Collectively, they generate and build on a legacy of front-line commitment, advanced academic and practical skills and passionate service to humanity.</p>

<p class="margin_bottom_20">Our mission as a global actor is to actively contribute to the social, cultural and political development of an increasingly globalised society. The challenges of today´s world – globalisation, poverty, economic inequality, failed states, insecurity, violence, intolerance, radicalism, extremism, terrorism, armed conflicts, human mobility and environmental degradation, among others - are multifaceted and transnational in nature. Responses and solutions to these challenges cause heated debate and controversy. Universities provide the right setting to enlighten these debates and shape the required multi-layered solutions. The contribution of the Global Campus of Human Rights universities, in particular, is to provide technical knowledge and expertise to guide these processes and to infuse them with ethical, human rights based perspectives. As universities specialized in the field of human rights and democratisation we feel a particular social responsibility to have an impact in our direct environment and sphere of influence. We do so by catalysing education, training, and research in order to generate knowledge, dialogues, cooperation, and agendas to be fed into the multidimensional sphere of human rights and democratisation.</p>
<p class="margin_bottom_20">Lack of understanding of human rights in itself is a significant challenge in most regions of the world and at all levels of society. The regional programmes of the Global Campus of Human Rights are uniquely equipped to face these challenges by encouraging a variety of communities to better understand human rights, promote their values, and develop skills for specific groups in government, civil society, and amongst professionals. The regional structure strengthens the role of universities in human rights by legitimising human rights education, ensuring multi-regional understandings, and increasing academic freedom.</p>
<p class="margin_bottom_20">As the biggest human rights education network in the world, we facilitate the dissemination of universal values - including human dignity, freedom, democracy, equality, the rule of law and respect for human rights - which are also core principles guiding the EU as a global player. Indeed, in our strategic plan we will work consistently with EU and UN policies, critically engaging with the following guiding documents:</p>
<ul class="lista_con_pallini">
    <li>the UN Agenda 2030 and the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs);</li>
    <li>the EU Action Plans on Human Rights and Democracy, the Global Strategy of the European Union’s Foreign and Security Policy, and the European Neighbourhood Policy;</li>
    <li>the EU Strategy for Youth – investing and empowering, and the Resolution on a EU Work Plan for Youth for 2016-2018;</li>
