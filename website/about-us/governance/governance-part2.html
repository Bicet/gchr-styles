It is based in Venice where it operates as a non-profit legal entity according to Italian law. </p>

<p class="text_read_more">As laid out in its Statute, the Global Campus is governed by the Assembly (represented by the Rectors of each member university), the Global Campus Council (the organisationâ€™s board of administrators, composed of 15 members), and the President and three Vice-Presidents. In addition, the Statute mandates a Secretary General, Honorary Presidents, an Advisory Board and a Statutory Auditor.<br><br>
The Assembly and Council bear primary responsibility for giving direction to and overseeing both regional and global activities of the member institutions, as well as the management of the EU grant and financial contributions made by other partners. </p>
