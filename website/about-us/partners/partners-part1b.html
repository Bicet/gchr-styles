<p>The EU, through the European Instrument for Democracy and Human Rights (EIDHR), is the primary funder and supporting organisation to EIUC / Global Campus. Education training and research have always been key elements of the EU’s policy on human rights and democratisation. With a view to implementing the EU’s policy on human rights and democratisation, the European Parliament and the European Commission took a strong initiative in supporting in 1997 the establishment of the European Master’s Degree Programme in Human Rights and Democratisation (E.MA), and of the other Regional Masters programmes in the subsequent years (ERMA and HRDA in 2000, APMA and CES in 2010, LATMA in 2011, ARMA in 2015) as well as in 2002 the European Inter-University Centre for Human Rights and Democratisation (EIUC), and in 2012 the Global Campus Action.</p>
