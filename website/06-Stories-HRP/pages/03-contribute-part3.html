<p class="subtitle_page_programme">Template for contributors</p>
<p class="margin_bottom_20">We ask that you use our template to submit your contribution. </p>

<ul class="lista_con_pallini margin_bottom_20">

	<li><strong>Title</strong>: no more than 100 characters. Aim for something that captures the essence of your contribution in a simple but interesting way. Readers like titles that are jargon-free, attention-grabbing and concise, and these titles are also much easier to share on social media. Avoid italics as they interfere with online sharing. </li>
	<li><strong>Tags</strong>: 4-5 relevant keywords at the top of your contribution. </li>
	<li><strong>Region</strong>: specify the GC region relevant to your contribution. If the contribution is relevant to more than one region, or if you offer a global perspective, please state this. </li>
	<li><strong>Discipline</strong>: specify the discipline or disciplines that inform your contribution (eg History; Law; Political Science). </li>
	<li><strong>Type</strong>: if you submit an audio or a video file (eg, an interview, a self-recording) please add a title and short summary. Submit any image as a stand-alone file and indicate the caption and full copyright attribution. Hyperlinks and images can be included in any text or image-based submission.</li>
	<li><strong>Length</strong>: text: max 700-1200 words | audio: max 5 minutes | video: max 3 minutes | slideshare: max 20 slides | photo essay: max 5 photos, each accompanied by text (max 1200 words) | announcements: max 200 words.</li>
	<li><strong>References</strong>: referencing must be via in-text citations. Embed hyperlinks to your sources; try to link to no more than 3 words in your text, and for any particular source, include the hyperlink only once in the text. Do not use footnotes. A reference list can be added as a separate file for video/audio submissions. </li>
	<li><strong>Originality</strong>: please indicate if your submission has been published or submitted for consideration elsewhere and if you have permission to republish. Where a submission has been prepared specifically for GC Human Rights Preparedness, once it has been published, you are welcome to submit it elsewhere, noting where it first appeared. </li>
	<li><strong>Language</strong>: UK English (eg, ise not ize), but we would be pleased to receive your submission in a second language too. Please avoid using Latin terms unless absolutely necessary. Avoid symbols too: our readers come from different disciplines, so if you are referring to a particular legal provision, use paragraph, section, etc. </li>
	<li><strong>Your name, title, affiliation and research interests</strong>: max 50 words.</li>
	<li><strong>Photo</strong>: please include a colour photograph of yourself. If your submission is a blogpost, you may also include a licence-free, high-resolution photograph that is directly relevant to the content of your submission. Please make sure the photo is of high quality (1920x1080px).</li>

</ul>
