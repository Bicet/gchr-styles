<h3 class="margin_bottom_20">Background</h3>
<p class="margin_bottom_20">The <a href="http://www.gchumanrights.org/">Global Campus of Human Rights</a> (Global Campus/GC) is a network of almost one hundred participating universities around the world, seeking to advance human rights and democracy through the organisation of seven Master’s programmes in different world regions (Europe, South-East Europe, the Caucasus region, Africa, Asia-Pacific, Latin America and Caribbean, and the Arab world) and through regional and global cooperation for education and research.</p>
<p>GC boasts more than twenty years of experience and an excellent track record in quality human rights education and training focused on:</p>
<ul class="lista_con_pallini">
    <li>post-graduate master’s programmes</li>
    <li>human rights training and summer schools</li>
    <li><a href="education/e-learning.html">e-learning activities</a></li>
</ul>
<p class="margin_bottom_20">that use both conventional and ground-breaking good practices, approaches and methods. This has allowed GC to continuously and increasingly build a solid and vast network of knowledge and expertise in teaching and training, both in person and online.</p>
<p><em>Global Campus e-learning activities</em></p>
<p class="margin_bottom_40">Online access to human rights courses, trainings, modules and materials is key to fostering a global community of learning and practice whose members are not only aware of their rights, but also able to develop wider and comparative understanding. The Global Campus offers such wider, comparative and practice-oriented e-learning experiences through Massive Open Online Courses (MOOCs), online courses and blended courses. Over the years we have developed a distinct online identity that we now wish to develop further.</p>

<h3 class="margin_bottom_20">Purpose and aims</h3>
<p class="margin_bottom_20">Increasing demand for e-learning programmes has evidenced the need for a constant, coherent and efficient production of video materials, interviews, e-lectures and other visual tools for optimal online delivery. In order to fulfil such need, GC is looking for a video company that would provide video production services to support forthcoming MOOCS and online courses. </p>
<p>The work considered under this invitation to tender encompasses different typologies of courses and themes, but is in general homogeneous in terms of approach and methodology and includes: </p>
<ul class="lista_con_pallini margin_bottom_20">
    <li>Support to GC in devising a coherent video production process and strategy</li>
    <li>Production and postproduction of videos:
        <ul class="lista_con_pallini">
            <li>Videos can be lectures or interviews with professors and experts or other types of videos such as interactive video quizzes, animated videos or a mix of lecture / power points /graphs / photos / explainers / timelines or any other post-production intervention that increases the usability and educational value of the video</li>
            <li>Video-production to be carried out by the awarded contractor only refers to videos to be recorded at the GC Venice premises. Videos that are filmed elsewhere will need only post-production</li>
            <li>The same video might request different editing / post-production interventions according to specific uses</li>
            <li>The duration of each video varies a lot, but it usually never goes beyond 1 hour.</li>
            <li>Covers are foreseen for each video </li>
            <li>The vast majority of the videos are in English, but some may need subtitles (texts provided by GC)The awarded contractor is expected to create and submit to the GC ‘boards’ that show intervention on the videos (text, images, charts, infographics) and that will need validation</li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li>Co-design, production and post-production of video teasers in English with a total running time not exceeding 3 minutes:
        <ul class="lista_con_pallini">
            <li>The teaser’s script is usually provided by the GC, but the contractor is expected to give suggestions to increase its quality. </li>
            <li>Teasers can include graphic animations or other visuals in addition to footage with professors and experts. For the latter, videos are mainly recorded in Venice, but may include some footage previously recorded elsewhere.</li>
            <li>The awarded contractor is expected to create and submit a moodboard with still-frames for each teaser. Various rounds of revisions and a final validation will ensue</li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li>Preparation of excerpts from the teasers (stills, clips, frames, etc.) to be used for promotional purposes on GC social media channels</li>
    <li>Suggestion, selection and purchase of tunes and music/audio files to increase the attractiveness of teasers and videos. Tunes can also be provided by the GC</li>
    <li>Iconographic search, including suggestion, selection and purchase of images and videos for both teasers and videos</li>
</ul>
<p class="margin_bottom_40">A total production of 60 videos (either new or existing ones that need editing), 4 teasers and max 10 days of filming is roughly estimated for the timeframe of this invitation to tender.</p>

    <li>acknowledge receipt of requests, instructions, files etc. and timely communicate about any progress and any issue about the implementation of the requested services. Repeated failure to do so will lead to consideration for termination of the agreement</li>

    <li>A video teaser (including with voice over, animation, music etc.) on the topic of Children’s Rights and Technology in the Digital Age on the basis of the following concept note:
        The intention of this project is to create the first-ever Massive Open Online Course (MOOC) on children’s rights and technology in the digital age, while simultaneously collecting information and testimonials on how this issue is materializing within different contexts around the globe. To date, there is a lack of approachable research and interdisciplinary conversation on this topic. Many users, including parents and children, place blind-trust, to varying degrees, in the promises of futuristic technologies, yet the positives and negatives of these rapidly evolving devices and algorithms have yet to be fully understood. The key stakeholders in developing these technologies may not always have a child’s best interest in mind, which is why everyday citizens, politicians, human-centric tech-advocates, and civil society need to proactively work towards creating a safe and healthy environment for children to learn and grow. The MOOC aims to close the information gap between experts and users, incubate productive public debate, and inspire action towards children’s rights advocacy.<br><br>
        The MOOC will include the following topics:
        <ul class="lista_con_pallini margin_bottom_20">
            <li>Introduction (on children’s rights, artificial Intelligence and biometrics, etc.)</li>
            <li>Children’s right to privacy and data protection (including facial recognition, surveillance, advertising, etc.)</li>
            <li>Early-childhood development </li>
            <li>Right to education </li>
            <li>Right to health</li>
        </ul>
        The objectives of the MOOCs are: provide a comprehensive overview on contemporary challenges regarding children’s rights and new technologies from an interdisciplinary perspective; spread awareness of this underrepresented topic; promote synergies between academics, activists, public sector employees, etc.; spark activism for children’s rights as an important focal point for law-makers, tech-developers, consumers and researchers across an interdisciplinary spectrum. </li>
</ul>
