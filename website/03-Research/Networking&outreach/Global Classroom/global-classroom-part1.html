<p class="margin_bottom_20">The Global Classroom brings together students and professors from all regional hubs for a week-long conference where a topic of common interest is studied, analysed and discussed. The discussion is enriched by the participation of experts, including representatives of States, UN Agencies, EU experts and civil society organisations.</p>
<p class="margin_bottom_20">The Global Classroom  facilitates interaction among students from the different regional programmes by organising dedicated activities and providing a forum for discussion and networking.</p>
<p class="margin_bottom_20">The opportunity to engage in research, to share findings with others and to engage in a conference-like setting is formative for students and stimulating for academics. Furthermore, the assigned research topics allows participants to explore characteristic challenges to human rights and democracy processes in their respective regions.
