<p class="margin_bottom_20">Every year a regional masterâ€™s programme takes the lead in organising an international conference/promotional event to raise awareness of the Global Campus network and foster discussion on current challenges to human rights and democratisation.</p>
<p>The objectives of this event are three-fold: to present the Global Campus activities to an audience of experts, academics and different stakeholders; to exchange research findings and thinking around human rights and democracy; and to engage in an interdisciplinary dialogue on process/actor-oriented, conceptual, and methodological issues in the context the different regions of the Global Campus.</p>
