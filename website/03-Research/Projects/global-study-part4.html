<p class="subtitle_page_programme">The importance of bringing the Global Study to all stakeholders</p>
<p class="margin_bottom_20">Following the presentation of the UNGA report relating to the Global Study to the UNGA Third Committee in New York on 8 October 2019, and the presentation of the comprehensive version of the Global Study to the UN in Geneva on 19 November 2019, it is pivotal for the findings of the Study to be presented in the different regions of the world and discuss the best way forward in implementing the findings and corresponding recommendations. The previous two Global Studies established mechanisms under the United Nations Secretary General, that of the two special representatives of the Secretary General on Violence against Children and Children and Armed conflicts. Nevertheless, in the previous studies it took at least a year to decide on a follow-up mechanism(s) and process.</p>
<p>During the interim decision making phase, the Global Campus has taken the initiative to keep the Global Study on the international agenda and support its dissemination activities. The cooperation between the GC and the Right Livelihood Foundation has taken a pivotal role in supporting the process of the Study to be presented in the different regions of the world. </p>
