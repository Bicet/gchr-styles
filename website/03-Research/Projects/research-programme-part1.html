<p class="margin_bottom_20">Annually the Global Campus Research Programme provides an opportunity to academics and students of the human rights masterâ€™s programmes to join together in a research project of current significance.</p>
<p class="margin_bottom_20">Since 2014, it has become established practice to link the Global Classroom event to the research programme. The benefits of connecting both the activity of research and discussion is to give the opportunity to students, academics and experts to interact in an open a lively forum and provide input which could feed into the research programme and enrich its findings.</p>
<p class="margin_bottom_20">A Coordinator and Regional Researchers are appointed to carry out the research, coordinate the contribution of each regional programme to the Global Classroom and ensure that the final study respects the standards set. In addition to that, the papers/articles of the new research programme will be subject to a peer-review process performed by the Editorial Committee and Editorial Board in order to be published on the GC e-journal.</p>
