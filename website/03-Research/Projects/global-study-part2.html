<p class="subtitle_page_programme">The making of the Global Study</p>
<p class="margin_bottom_20">
To address this situation, in December 2014 the United Nations General Assembly invited the United Nations Secretary-General to commission an in-depth Global Study on Children Deprived of Liberty (A/RES/69/157 §52.d).</p>
<p> In October 2016, Manfred Nowak was appointed as Independent Expert to lead the Global Study. He submitted his final report on the Study to the General Assembly and presented it during its seventy-fourth session (Resolution 72/245 §37). The Global Study was carried out in close cooperation with Governments, UN agencies and actors, including OHCHR, UNICEF, UNODC, UNHCR, IOM, WHO, the Special Representative of the Secretary-General on violence against children, the Special Representative of the Secretary-General for children and armed conflict, the Committee on the Rights of the Child (CRC), as well as civil society organizations (over 170) and academia. The process included thematic, national and regional consultations all around the world where also children views and perspectives were consulted.</p>
