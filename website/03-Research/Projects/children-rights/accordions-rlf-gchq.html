                    <p class="margin_bottom_20">Child rights strategic litigation (CRSL) - defined as litigation that seeks to bring about legal and social change in terms of children’s enjoyment of their rights – is a pressing topic in advocacy and academic circles. Given its increased deployment as a tool for advancing children’s rights by a range of different actors, it is vital to engage effectively with the challenges and opportunities presented by CRSL.</p>
                    <p class="margin_bottom_20">Focused on the development, implementation, impact assessment and critique of CRSL from a child rights perspective, this project will contribute directly to strengthening the capacity of such litigation to deliver on children’s rights globally. It will do so by expanding academic engagement with CRSL, while bringing a number of key CRSL cases before judicial and quasi-judicial bodies.</p>
                    <p class="margin_bottom_20">The project seeks to effect concrete change via a practical methodology where academia and activism meet in the service of children’s rights. As such, the project entails a continuous exchange between research and practice directed towards concrete real-world impact.</p>

                    <p class="margin_bottom_20">Children and their right to liberty were the subject of the UN Global Study on Children Deprived of Liberty (GS). Children were also involved in the Study to make sure that their voices were heard. The GS team has recently completed a child-friendly summary and an executive summary of the GS as part of the Follow-Up Initiation Process. Within this framework, the goal of this project is to create a high-quality animated video for children aged 14-18 year in English, Spanish, French and Arabic (four of the widest spoken languages). Such a multilingual, educational movie will not only ensure that a wider children population is reached, but also that children actually spend time in watching an educational product that best suit their age and learning style, therefore improving learning and retention. </p>
                    <p class="margin_bottom_20">In addition, also adult audiences with no or very limited knowledge on the issue of children deprived of liberty will benefit from such a cartoon. The animated video will mainly target schools and educational institutions via the many GC and RLF networks and partners across the globe.</p>

                        <li>Phase 3: The live event will take place from 7-9 September, when students from each region and inter-regional working group will present their findings and recommendations. As part of this online event, a high-level panel (with Manfred Nowak, Najat Maalla M´Jid, Felipe Morales González, Karabo Ozah and Benoit Van Keirsbilck) will share their experiences working for and with children deprived of liberty. Students will be given the opportunity to ask them questions based on the respective research they have done on the Global Study.</li>
                        <li>Phase 4: Each region is given the opportunity to involve students in the organisation of regional events so as to discuss their findings with local authorities, experts, stakeholders and general audiences.</li>

Climate change and a degraded environment have a demonstrated detrimental effect on children’s lives. While various initiatives around the globe focus on protecting children from such effect, far less attention is devoted to recognising that children have a right to participate in decisions about how to deal with the impact of environmental crisis – i.e. how to deal with their future.</p>
                    <p class="margin_bottom_20">Placed at the intersection of Child Participation, Human Rights and the Environment, this Massive Open Online Course (MOOC) will be a truly unique educational and advocacy tool that is not available elsewhere. Through free and open access to current knowledge and debates on critical issues and practical options for rights-based youth activism on climate change, it will reach a worldwide audience to inform those who are still unaware, encourage those who are curious to know more, support those who are already acting, and ultimately boost effective change. </p>
