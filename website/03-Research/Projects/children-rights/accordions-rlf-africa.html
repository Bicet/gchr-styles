                    <p>[nbsp]</p>
                    <p class="margin_bottom_20">This is a three-year project at the intersection of three key areas: child participation rights, the global and regional development agenda as set out in the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), and African regional development frameworks (ARDFs), particularly the African Union Agenda 2063 and the African Union Agenda 2040 for Children.</p>
                    <p class="margin_bottom_10">The overall project goal is to promote (and increase public awareness on the importance of) child participation in national, regional and international development processes in Africa. This goal will be achieved through three main interventions:</p>
                    <ul class="lista_con_pallini margin_bottom_20">
                        <li>research for evidence and knowledge on the standards and practice on child participation in development governance</li>
                        <li>evidence-based advocacy for child participation in development governance</li>
                        <li>and capacity building to enhance the implementation of child participation in the framework</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p class="margin_bottom_20">Specifically, the project will include a regional study on child participation in development frameworks in Africa; capacity building for key stakeholders; regular engagement with stakeholders on the need and means of child participation; generating contextually relevant tools for implementation; monitoring of child participation in development governance; and facilitating dialogue on the manner and means of ensuring child participation in governance. </p>

                    <p class="margin_bottom_20">The proposed project is a national follow-up to the Global Study on Children Deprived of Liberty based at the University of Pretoria. in June 2018 South Africa presented the numbers of children in detention in its response to the Global Study questionnaire. Among the numbers provided was the number of children in Secure Care Centres. This was significant because it was the first time that the number was captured in a manner that was comparable to other statistics, such as the number of children in prison. </p>
                    <p class="margin_bottom_10">The project’s main objective is to create a mechanism for independent oversight to reinforce the rights of children in secure care in South Africa. This includes the following sub-objectives:</p>
                    <ul class="lista_con_pallini margin_bottom_20">
                        <li>undertake a base-line study of the current secure care centres, through visits to the secure care centres and interviews with children and with staff, to inform the independent oversight mechanism;</li>
                        <li>develop a model of an independent oversight mechanism to reinforce the right of children in secure care; </li>
                        <li>develop a plan for the management and care of children in secure care in situations of disaster/emergency, to be built into the oversight mechanism.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p class="margin_bottom_20">Specifically, the project will include a regional study on child participation in development frameworks in Africa; capacity building for key stakeholders; regular engagement with stakeholders on the need and means of child participation; generating contextually relevant tools for implementation; monitoring of child participation in development governance; and facilitating dialogue on the manner and means of ensuring child participation in governance. </p>

                    <p class="margin_bottom_20">Based on the experience obtained with the <a href="https://www.icla.up.ac.za/national-schools-moot" target="_blank" class="titolo_gc_africa">South African Schools Human Rights Moot Court Competition</a>, the Centre for Human Rights at the University of Pretoria will work with local partners to <a href="https://www.icla.up.ac.za/world-schools-moot" target="_blank" class="titolo_gc_africa">establish similar competitions in other parts of the world</a>. Specifically, the project will first be established in Ethiopia, Ghana and Nepal. This will then be followed by other countries worldwide.</p>
                    <p class="margin_bottom_20">Schools human rights moots have shown to be valuable educational tools enabling children to solve problems based on a human rights framework.</p>
                    <p class="margin_bottom_10">The model we are pursuing is the following:</p>
                    <ul class="lista_con_pallini margin_bottom_20">
                        <li>The moots are based on a hypothetical problem, which the learners have to address as if they are the lawyers for the applicant and then also for the respondents.</li>
                        <li>Their arguments should be based on the bill of rights of their country.</li>
                        <li>The final round of the moot takes place in the highest court of the country.</li>
                        <li>Where possible, participation in the moot is part of the school curriculum.</li>
                        <li>The national human rights institution of the country in question facilitates the organisation of the moot.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p class="margin_bottom_20">Ultimately, it is anticipated that these moots will culminate in a world human rights moot court competition for high school learners.</p>
