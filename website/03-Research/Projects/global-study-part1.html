<p class="margin_bottom_20">
Childhood is when children develop their personality, their emotional relationships with others, their social and educational skills and their talents. Depriving them of liberty means depriving them of their childhood. Placing children in institutions and other facilities where they are, or may be, deprived of liberty is difficult to reconcile with the Convention on the Rights of the Child (CRC).</p>
<p>Article 37b CRC clearly states that deprivation of liberty of children shall be used only as a measure of last resort and for the shortest appropriate period of time. </p>
