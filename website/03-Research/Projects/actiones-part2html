<p class="subtitle_page_programme">The Project</p>
<p class="margin_bottom_20">The ACTIONES project was based on the premise that a high and coherent standard of fundamental rights protection within the EU requires more than simple knowledge of the EU Charter of Fundamental Rights. This must be complemented by a deep social and political sensitivity; awareness and swiftness in adopting procedural solutions offered by various legal orders; and readiness to engage in an open exchange of views. Such qualities and competences should be nurtured, taking into account the time and resource constraints that judges and lawyers face in their everyday work.</p>
<p class="margin_bottom_20">The ACTIONES project aimed at responding to the above needs through a set of transnational and local training events, which were based on an easy-to-use toolkit through which legal practitioners could familiarise themselves with the techniques of vertical and horizontal interaction between European and national courts. The overall aim of the initiative was to ensure the effective implementation of the Charter of Fundamental Rights and adequate remedies to its violations.</p>
