<p class="subtitle_page_programme">Global Study on Children Deprived of Liberty</p>
<p class="margin_bottom_20">In October 2016, EIUC Secretary General Manfred Nowak was appointed as Independent Expert leading the United Nations Global Study on Children Deprived of Liberty, which had been commissioned by the United Nations Secretary-General upon invitation by the General Assembly in its Resolution 69/157 of 18 December 2014.</p>
<p>The Global Study will build upon the experiences from two previous UN Studies on children: The report of Graça Machel on the Impact of Armed Conflict on Children as well as the United Nations Study on Violence against Children, led by Paulo Sérgio Pinheiro, which provide us with a good blueprint for undertaking the Global Study. The Global Study will be carried out in close cooperation with Governments, UN agencies and actors, including OHCHR, UNICEF, UNODC, UNHCR, the Special Representative of the Secretary-General on violence against children, the Special Representative of the Secretary-General for children and armed conflict, the Committee on the Rights of the Child (CRC), as well as civil society organizations and academia. The process will include thematic, national and regional consultations, which will take into account views from around the world. The input of all stakeholders is essential for the Global Study to provide sound evidence and recommendations to support the Member States in their efforts to prevent children’s deprivation of liberty and safeguard the rights of children deprived of liberty.</p>
