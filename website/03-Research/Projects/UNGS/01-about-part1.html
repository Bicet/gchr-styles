<p class="margin_bottom_20">The UN Global Study on Children Deprived of Liberty, published in 2019, is a comprehensive Study conducted by Manfred Nowak, a large team of experts from all over the world and 274 children who were interviewed. The findings of the Study concern six thematic areas in which children live deprived of liberty: juvenile justice, detention with their primary caregivers, for migration-related reasons, in institutions, in the context of armed conflict or on national security grounds.</p>

<p class="margin_bottom_20">The Study also focuses on the gender dimension, the impact on the health of the children and children with disabilities, as well the views and perspectives of children themselves. According to the research more than 7 million children are currently living in deprivation of liberty. In addition to other findings related to the specific thematic areas, this comprehensive publication also contains a large set of recommendations.</p>
<p>As a follow-up to the Study, many activities have been funded in order to implement these recommendations. </p>
