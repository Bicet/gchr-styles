        <p class="margin_bottom_20">The Global Study was published in 2019 and reprinted in a corrected version in 2020. The Global Study Team has created an Executive Summary of 68 pages that outlines the key messages and recommendations of the 800-page long Global Study. The Global Campus will partner up with its regional child rights officers to identify students/graduates of the regional Master’s programmes to translate the Executive Summary in all UN languages: Arabic, Chinese, French, Russian and Spanish.</p>
        <p class="margin_bottom_20">The translated versions of the Executive Summary will facilitate further Global Study related research and advocacy projects and support the dissemination and implementation of the Global Study recommendations. </p>

        <p class="margin_bottom_20">The goal of this project is to create a high-quality animated video of the Global Study for children aged 14-18 years in English, Spanish, French and Arabic. Such a multilingual, educational short film will not only ensure that a wider children population is reached, but also that children actually spend time watching an educational product that best suit their age and learning style, therefore improving learning and retention.</p>
        <p class="margin_bottom_20">In addition, also adult audiences with no or very limited knowledge on the issue of children deprived of liberty will benefit from such a creative visualisation. The video will mainly target schools and educational institutions via the many Global Campus and RLF networks and partners across the globe.</p>

        <p class="margin_bottom_10">Two workshops will be organised at the Headquarters of the Global Campus of Human Rights in Venice:</p>
        <ul class="lista_con_pallini margin_bottom_20">
            <li><strong>Workshop 1</strong> will be held with specialised, independent, national and regional institutions existing in Italy</li>

        <p class="margin_bottom_20">The two workshops aim to present the findings and recommendations of the Global Study among independent children’s rights institutions (ICRIs), and discuss with them the challenges and opportunities related to their implementation both at the national and European level. By sharing information about specific areas of the Global Study, these workshops open a space to identify possible roles and actions for ICRIs in effectively supporting and facilitating the development of strategies/action plans for such enactment.</p>

        <p class="margin_bottom_20">In its response to the Global Study questionnaire, in June 2018 South Africa presented the numbers of children in detention. Among the numbers provided was the number of children in Secure Care Centres. This was significant because it was the first time that the number was captured in a manner that was comparable to other statistics, such as the number of children in prison. </p>
        <p class="margin_bottom_10">The project’s main goal is to create a mechanism for independent oversight to reinforce the rights of children in secure care in South Africa. This includes the following objectives:</p>
        <ul class="lista_con_pallini margin_bottom_20">
            <li>Undertake a base-line study of the current Secure Care Centres, through visits to those centres and interviews with children and staff aimed at informing the independent oversight mechanism</li>

            <li>Develop a plan for the management and care of children in secure care in situations of disaster/emergency, to be integrated into the oversight mechanism</li>

        <p class="margin_bottom_20">Following one of the main recommendations of the Global Study, the overarching aim of this project is to identify and promote the most effective existing data collection frameworks in one of the most challenging and neglected areas: detention for migration-related reasons. Since this phenomenon is unlikely to be completely eradicated in the near future, establishment of data collection systems at national levels is crucial to measure progress in the long run. </p>

        <ul class="lista_con_pallini margin_bottom_20">
            <li>Phase 1: Each of the seven Global Campus regions worked on regional thematic research papers (to be published in the <a href="https://repo.gchumanrights.org/handle/20.500.11825/29" class="titolo_gc_europe" target="_blank">Global Campus Human Rights Journal</a> - GCHRJ)</li>
            <li>Phase 2: Students were divided into inter-regional working groups to discuss and debate the research papers each region produced</li>
            <li>Phase 3: In a live event, which took place from 7 to 9 September 2020, students from each region and inter-regional working group presented their findings and recommendations. As part of this online event, a high-level panel (with Manfred Nowak, Najat Maalla M´Jid, Felipe Morales González, Karabo Ozah and Benoit Van Keirsbilck) shared their experiences working for and with children deprived of liberty</li>
            <li>Phase 4: Each region is given the opportunity to involve students in the organisation of regional events in order to discuss their findings with local authorities, experts, stakeholders and general audiences</li>

This project is coordinated by the University of Nottingham and comes under the auspices of the Global Campus-Right Livelihood Foundation Partnership Agreement.</p>
        <p class="margin_bottom_20">The project “Child rights strategic litigation” (CRSL) seeks to use legal cases as a tool to bring legal and social change in terms of children’s enjoyment of their rights. It focuses on the development, implementation, impact assessment and critique of strategic litigation from a child rights perspective, and will contribute directly to strengthening the capacity of such litigation to deliver on children‘s rights globally. The project will expand academic engagement with CRSL, while bringing a number of key CRSL cases before judicial and quasi-judicial bodies.</p>
