<p>In addition to comprehensive research conducted by scholars affiliated with our roughly 100 participating universities, the EIUC and Global Campus also carry out a number of targeted joint research projects related to current developments and challenges in the field of human rights and democracy.</p>
<p>These projects include both EU-funded collaborative studies, such as FRAME and ACTIONES, and research initiated by the Global Campus itself. The UN Global Study on Children Deprived of Liberty takes advantage of the rich and diverse perspectives of the universities participating in the Global Campus.</p>
