<p class="subtitle_page_programme">e-NACT</p>
<p class="margin_bottom_20">The e-NACT (e-learning National Active Charter Training) project was a DG Justice supported project (2018-2019) providing for a training methodology and training activities that, coupled with the expertise of the trainers involved, foster the emergence and consolidation of a common culture of fundamental rights. The e-NACT project was coordinated by the EUI and involved several universities and European institutes, including the Free University of Brussels and the Odysseus Network. The project provided training activities and tools in areas of crucial importance for the application of the EU Charter of Fundamental Rights:</p>
<ul class="lista_con_pallini margin_bottom_20">
<li>Asylum and migration</li>
<li>Data protection</li>
<li>Children rights</li>
<li>Social rights in the labour field</li>
<li>Freedom of expression</li>
</ul>
<p>Its main objective is to assist national legal practitioners to become familiar with the application of the Charter.</p>

<p class="subtitle_page_programme">Our role</p>
<p class="margin_bottom_20">In the course of the project e-NACT, the Global Campus of Human Rights oversaw the process of preparation of five online courses, three of which were its sole responsibility whilst the remaining two were prepared in collaboration with the EUI and Odysseus Network.</p>
<p class="margin_bottom_20">The courses followed a common logic in their development and built on the initial basic course dedicated to the general issues of application of the EU Charter of Fundamental Rights. The subsequent substantive focus was placed on data protection, migration and asylum law, freedom of expression and hate speech, children’s rights, and social rights in labour law.</p>
<p class="margin_bottom_20">EEach of the courses was delivered by academics and was enriched through the insights of judges and practicing lawyers. The ultimate objective was to blend the use of the online courses with the in-class teaching based on the research and materials prepared during the project and in the course of the research and training activities undertaken by the EUI Centre for Judicial Cooperation and the Global Campus.</p>


<p class="subtitle_page_programme">Activities</p>
<p class="margin_bottom_20">The e-NACT project created an easy-to-use training toolkit consisting of traditional and e-learning tools that were the basis for a set of 16 Training Workshops targeting national judges, lawyers and other selected legal practitioners. It promoted judicial interaction, which boosted mutual trust and cooperation among domestic legal practitioners. Additionally, the database of national case law set up through previous CJC projects was extended.</p>
<p>At least 422 legal practitioners across varied EU Member States were trained. This number was multiplied by training the trainers themselves and making the toolkit freely available online (in its entirety) upon the Project completion.</p>


<p class="subtitle_page_programme">Expected results</p>
<ul class="lista_con_pallini margin_bottom_20">
	<li>Increasing awareness and capability of legal practitioners to use judicial interaction techniques as a way to enhance the effectiveness of the Charter in topical areas of the EU’s activity;</li>
	<li>Consolidating a sound training toolkit that assists national trainers to pass the knowledge gathered to other legal practitioners;</li>
	<li>Ensuring that the successful outcomes of previous CJC-led Projects are kept alive and updated.</li>
</ul>

<p class="subtitle_page_programme">Outputs</p>
<p class="margin_bottom_20">The main tools hosted by the <em>e-NACT Training Platform</em> were:</p>
<ul class="lista_con_pallini margin_bottom_20">
	<li>5 training <em>curricula </em>in the selected areas</li>
	<li>5 online modules</li>
	<li>10 national training curricula</li>
	<li>16 training évents (6 transnational, 10 national)</li>
	<li>extended version of the database set up through the previous CJC Projects</li>
	<li>training methodology guidelines</li>
</ul>


<p class="subtitle_page_programme">Transnational training workshops</p>
<p class="margin_bottom_20">The Transnational training workshops provided the participants with a platform for the transnational mutual exchange of their experiences, difficulties and best practices related to the application of the Charter.</p>
<p class="margin_bottom_20">They offered the environment where there are no longer any of the major obstacles that usually prevent legal practitioners from benefiting from a direct interaction with their colleagues and with academics – time-constraints, linguistic skills, accessibility of sources. Each Workshop ran for 2 days and involved a target group of 30 of legal practitioners.</p>
<p class="margin_bottom_20">The training was be based on the training materials drafted within the project:</p>
<ul class="lista_con_pallini margin_bottom_20">
	<li>Thematic Handbooks</li>
	<li>E-booklet on the use of the Charter</li>
	<li>Hypothetical cases</li>
</ul>

<p class="subtitle_page_programme">National training workshops</p>
<p class="margin_bottom_20">The National Training Workshops were held in the Spring 2019 and replicated the format and methodology experimented with in transnational training workshops. The events involved legal practitioners from the Member State of the partner responsible for the organisation of the event.</p>
<p class="margin_bottom_20">Each Workshop involved approximately 20 to 30 legal practitioners. The topic of the national training workshops was defined on the basis of the needs of the judges and lawyers at local level.</p>
