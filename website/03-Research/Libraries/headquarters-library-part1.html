<p class="margin_bottom_20">Without its library we could not realise its potential as a Centre of Excellence of Human Rights. Students, teachers and participants in all educational activities appreciate its high academic quality and level of specialisation.</p>
<p class="margin_bottom_20">The Monastery of San Nicolò houses a specialised, multi-disciplinary library devoted to publications on human rights and democratisation topics. It includes high-quality printed resources, books, journals, non-conventional publications, and the theses produced by EMA students.</p>
<p class="margin_bottom_20">The library subscribes to several online journals, the HeinOnline core collection, and Brill’s Human Rights and Humanitarian Law e-books collections from 2011 to 2016, and the most relevant open access databases.</p>
