    <p class="margin_bottom_20">e-NACT 0 is an introductory additional course allowing all the learners to test and update their knowledge on the general principles connected with triggering the application of the EU Charter of Fundamental Rights in national contexts.</p>

    <p class="margin_bottom_20">This is a complementary course conceived of as an introduction to the remaining five online courses offered within the ambit of the e-NACT project led by Centre for Judicial Cooperation based at the European University Institute with the participation of the Global Campus of Human Rights and the variety of national institutions offering trainings to judges in national contexts.</p>

    <p class="subtitle_page_programme">Course Outline</p>

    <p class="margin_bottom_20">This is a one-week long course only. It is organized into two parts:</p>

            <ul class="lista_con_pallini margin_bottom_20">
                <li>substantive rules on the application of the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union based on its Art. 51 and the manner in which the Court of Justice of the European Union interpreted its content and national practices in the application of rules;</li>

                <li>procedural rules allowing for triggering the application of the EU Charter of Fundamental Rights, contesting the content of specific rights or national practices related to its application. These rules are rooted in constitutional principles of European Union law, their use opens avenues for discussion with other jurisdictions and leading to the ultimate granting of high standards of fundamental rights protection to EU citizens.</li>
            </ul>

            <p class="margin_bottom_20">Aside from outlining the rules and demonstrating how they function with the use of real life examples, the course is designed as a guide to existing sources for self-learning that have been developed over the past years to facilitate the work of practitioners (in particular, the judges) whenever the issue related to the applicability of the EU Charter and its rights comes to the forefront.</p>
           </div>



<div class="ce_text description_page_programme block">
    <p class="subtitle_page_programme">Lecturers and Experts</p>

    <p class="margin_bottom_20">The e-NACT courses feature a group of academics, judges, and other practitioners passionate for fundamental rights and willing to spread the knowledge about them both within their professional networks and beyond. As the courses build on the trans-national trainings conducted within the e-NACT project, we invited also experts that delivered these residential training to enrichen the online courses with their perspectives and experience.</p>

    <p class="subtitle_page_programme">The overall Project</p>

    <p class="margin_bottom_20"><strong>e-learning National Active Charter Training</strong>(e-NACT) Project is a DG Justice supported project providing for a training methodology and training activities that, coupled with the expertise of the trainers involved, foster the emergence and consolidation of a common culture of fundamental rights. By discussing with academics and with foreign colleagues their difficulties or good practices with respect to the application of the EU Charter, legal practitioners will deepen their understanding and equip themselves with new instruments and notions to use it effectively.For this purpose, e-NACT will offer systematic, interdisciplinary, interconnected and combined residential and e-learning training on five fundamental rights guaranteed in the EU Charter.</p>

    <p class="margin_bottom_20">The following courses are offered within this project:</p>
