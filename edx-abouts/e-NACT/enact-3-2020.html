    <h3 class="title_page_programme titolo_gc_europe margin_bottom_30">Children's Rights in the EU Charter</h3>


<p class="margin_bottom_20">The fundamental rights of children as guaranteed by the EU Charter of Fundamental Rights is one of the topics that cuts across legal disciplines giving rise to a broad range of issues. This course aims at providing an overview of these problems.</p>
<p class="margin_bottom_20">The course takes learners across the general presentation of the varieties of contexts where children’s rights emerge. In doing so, it builds on the guiding principle of the best interest of the child both in the EU and international context. Learners will subsequently explore how rights of the child are shaped in the context of provisions ruling EU citizens and third country citizens in the context of asylum in migration. Finally, children’s rights will be presented within the area of the judicial cooperation in civil matters.</p>
<p class="margin_bottom_20">This is the third of five e-learning courses offered within the ambit of the e-NACT project, this time delivered by the University of Florence.</p>

    <p class="subtitle_page_programme">The overall Project</p>

    <p class="margin_bottom_20"><strong>e-learning National Active Charter Training</strong>(e-NACT) Project is a DG Justice supported project providing for a training methodology and training activities that, coupled with the expertise of the trainers involved, foster the emergence and consolidation of a common culture of fundamental rights. By discussing with academics and with foreign colleagues their difficulties or good practices with respect to the application of the EU Charter, legal practitioners will deepen their understanding and equip themselves with new instruments and notions to use it effectively.For this purpose, e-NACT will offer systematic, interdisciplinary, interconnected and combined residential and e-learning training on five fundamental rights guaranteed in the EU Charter.</p>
