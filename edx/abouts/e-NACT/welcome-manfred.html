<p>Welcome and thank you for choosing the e-NACT courses!</p>
<p>Welcome to this series of massive open online courses (MOOCs) dedicated to the problems associated with the application of the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union.</p>
<p>We are glad you chose to follow this and possibly other courses offered to you as a part of the e-NACT project, a research and training initiative sponsored by the European Commission, offering the legal and related disciplines an insight into the intricacies of the judicial application of the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union. This series of MOOCs arrives to you as a result of cooperation between a vast array of partners including national judicial schools, facilitated and coordinated by the Centre of Judicial Cooperation and delivered with the knowledge and technical support of the Global Campus of Human Rights.</p>
<p>The purpose of this series is to disseminate knowledge on application of the EU Charter of Fundamental Rights in the following areas: freedom of expression, social rights, children&rsquo;s rights, rights of illegal migrants and, finally, data protection. In each of these areas, the EU Charter serves as a point of reference for interpretation and application of law, which often strays beyond the beaten paths and offers new avenues for resolving complex social and political issues.</p>
<p>We take for granted that you are already well acquainted with the structure of the European Union legal system in general and the European Union system of fundamental rights protection in particular. The e-NACT courses are designed knowing that our learners have at least the theoretical foundations of this knowledge, if not practical experience, behind its application. Should you however wish to refresh your knowledge on the substantive and procedural principles behind the application of the EU Charter of Fundamental Rights, we have prepared for you an additional, one-week long course (&ldquo;0&rdquo;).</p>
<p>All of these courses can be enjoyed alongside or instead of encounters with your colleagues in a classroom context; your participation in the online courses will be rewarded with a certificate as to its completion.</p>
<p>We invite you to sit back and start one of the e-NACT MOOCs and enhance your knowledge and skills.</p>
<p>Once you are done, do not forget to explore other online and residential courses offered by the Global Campus of Human Rights and the Centre for Judicial Cooperation!</p>
<p>Enjoy and good luck!</p>
