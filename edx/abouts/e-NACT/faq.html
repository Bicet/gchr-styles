Each week of the course includes one or two video lectures with accompanying transcripts and reading materials. The texts are in PDF format, work at low bandwidths, are printable and can be zoomed to the desired size. Some readings may include pages from accessible websites. This makes all of them accessible to those who use assistive technology software such as screen readers. Likewise, weekly discussions and module quizzes can be completed through our platform which is accessible, for example, to people who use speech input, keyboard accessible controls or text to speech tools.

                <div class="ce_text block">
                    <p>Discussions are based on an initial question/prompt that refers to the content studied in a particular week and that usually gives you the opportunity to discuss, share examples, propose ideas, and interact with other participants. Participation in discussions is part of the learning process for all. Therefore, we trust each active participant will make meaningful contributions (so please note that a simple answer such as "I agree" will not be considered valid for the purpose of earning the certificate of participation). Due to the large number of participants, it might be difficult to follow all inputs, but you can easily search the discussion forum with keywords, names, issues, etc. Responses are also nested so that if you respond to another participant, you'll see the flow of your exchanges immediately below the initial input. At times it might be useful to create a group discussion if participants are particularly interested in further exchanges on a specific sub-issue. In such cases, the coordinating team will set up another discussion and interested participants will be able to join this one too.</p>

                <div class="ce_text block">
                    <p>Quizzes are foreseen at the end of each Module in order for you to check your understanding and progress. They are based on 5 questions and require a score of 4/5 to pass. They consist of different types of questions (true/false; yes/no; multiple choice; multiple answer) and once open, they remain available until the end of the course. You can have unlimited attempts and can see what answers you got wrong/right. However, for a more effective and satisfactory learning experience we warmly encourage you to take the quizzes after having prepared for them properly and not at random.
