<h3 class="title_page_programme titolo_gc_europe margin_bottom_30">Children Deprived of Liberty: Enacting the recommendations of the UN Global Study</h3>
<div class="ce_text description_page_programme block">
    <p class="margin_bottom_20">In 2019 the UN Global Study on Children Deprived of Liberty denounced that more than seven million children worldwide are deprived of liberty every year. It provided an assessment of the situation in different contexts and set out clear recommendations for change. This roadmap is an inspiration for new laws, policies, and practices that can help States dramatically reduce the number of children behind bars and locked doors. Keeping the conversation going and monitoring the enactment of the recommendations is key to ensure that children worldwide are no longer deprived of their childhood.</p>
    <p class="margin_bottom_20">This MOOC is a complement to a <a href="https://edx.gchumanrights.org/courses/course-v1:gchumanrights+ungs+2020/about" target="_blank" class="titolo_gc_europe">previous Global Campus course on the Global Study</a> and aims at providing updated information on situations, challenges and possible solutions as they are being envisaged in each region of the world. Hearing from experts, researchers, and children themselves, participants will learn about steps being taken in terms of deinstitutionalisation, diversion, ending migration-related detention and other measures. </p>

    <p class="subtitle_page_programme">Course Outline</p>
    <p class="margin_bottom_20">The course is articulated in two modules:</p>
    <p class="margin_bottom_20"><strong>Module 1</strong> is an introduction to the <strong>UN Global Study as a framework for action</strong>. Specific attention will be paid here to the Study’s recommendations and the developing follow-up initiatives which are being enacted in cooperation with different stakeholders, from UN agencies to governments, from civil society to academia.</p>
    <p class="margin_bottom_20"><strong>Module 2</strong> is dedicated to <strong>regional perspectives</strong> and a variety of recent initiatives, examples and practices that are being implemented there. In so doing, the course specifically analyses the most relevant issues and themes in each region: from immigration detention to deinstitutionalisation, from deprivation of liberty for national security reasons, to diversion measures. </p>
