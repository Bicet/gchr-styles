    <h3 class="title_page_programme titolo_gc_europe margin_bottom_30" style="max-width: 650px">Promoting and Protecting Human Rights: a Global Overview</h3>
    <p class="margin_bottom_20">Human rights are an inherent part of every individual. They are the outcome of long struggles and achievements. Responding to the necessity to counter - and in the future prevent - the tragic effects of genocide, war, economic depression, nationalism and colonialism, they were engraved in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights as "a common standard of achievement for all peoples and all nations". Then, they carried the hope for freedom, justice and peace in the world. Today, they are often questioned, attacked, dismissed and violated. But they still stand to remind us that “we are all born equal and free in dignity and rights”.</p>
    <p class="margin_bottom_40">Promoting and protecting human rights is yet a work in progress. Much still needs to be done, but we can build on the concrete improvements and achievements that human rights have already allowed over the years. We can defend cases, advocate for change and bring about progress on the basis of legal instruments and mechanisms: laws, institutions, courts. We can face challenges with the strength of the benefits that have been demonstrated around the world: greater freedom and democracy; better health, education, and standards of living. To continue our efforts, we need information, education, awareness and action. This course provides you with a solid basis to understand, know and stand up for human rights.</p>

                        <div class="ce_text block">
                            <p>Discussions are based on an initial question/prompt that refers to the content studied in a particular week and that usually gives you the opportunity to discuss, share examples, propose ideas, and interact with other participants. You can access discussions from the course outline, or from the relevant week where they are presented, or from the tab "Discussions" at the top of the course page.</p>
                            <p>Discussions counting toward the certificate are introduced by the staff (you will recognise a staff icon in the discussion heading), are numbered, and are pinned to the top of the list of Discussions. You are free to create your own discussions as well, but if you wish to receive the certificate, please ensure that you have answered at least 5 of the pinned discussions. Please also bear in mind that participation in discussions is part of the learning process for all. Therefore, we trust each active participant will make meaningful contributions after having studied the related materials (so a simple answer such as "I agree" will not be considered valid for the purpose of earning the certificate of participation).</p>
                            <p>Due to the large number of participants, it might be difficult to follow all inputs, but you can easily search the discussion forum with keywords, names, issues, etc. Responses are also nested so that if you respond to another participant, you'll see the flow of your exchanges immediately below the initial input.</p>

They are based on 5 questions and require a score of 4/5 to pass. They consist of different types of questions (true/false; yes/no; multiple choice; multiple answer) and once open, they remain available until the end of the course.</p>
                            <p>You can have unlimited attempts and can see what answers you got wrong/right. However, for a more effective and satisfactory learning experience we warmly encourage you to take the quizzes after having prepared for them properly and not at random.
